### Configuring Your Application
Duration: 20:00

The Helloworld Service is configured to return a message that uses the following template:
[source,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
Hello {name} from {hostname} with {version}
----

There are several ways to update this configuration. We'll go through a couple of them, including:

* Environment variable
* Command line argument
* And, ConfigMap
