### Deploy a frontend Service
Duration 3:00

Each Pod has a unique IP address - but the address is ephemeral.  The Pod IP addresses are not stable and it can change when Pods start and/or restart. A service provides a single access point to a set of pods matching some constraints. A Service IP address is stable.

Create the frontend service:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl create -f frontend-service.yaml*
service "frontend-ui" created
----

And check it:

[source, bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl get services*
NAME          CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                   PORT(S)        AGE
frontend-ui   172.30.40.241   172.29.133.81,172.29.133.81   80:32476/TCP   7s
