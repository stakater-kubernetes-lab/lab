## Setup environment
Duration: 15:00

This section describes what, how, and where to install the software needed for this lab. This lab is designed for a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

### Hardware

- Operating System: Windows 7 (SP1), Mac OS X (10.8 or later), Fedora (21 or later)
- Memory: At least 4 GB+, preferred 8 GB

### Software

#### Development tools

Make sure to have the following tools/packages installed:

- GIT
- Maven

#### CDK

link:http://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/[Red Hat Container Development Kit] is a pre-built container development environment based on RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux to help you get started developing container-based applications quickly. 

Developers can get the Red Hat Container Development Kit via no-cost Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ® Developer Suite subscription for development purposes by link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/download/[registering and downloading] through link:developers.redhat.com/[developers.redhat.com]. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure to take notes of your username(email) and password. It will be used as the free subscription for RHEL.

Setup CDK:

- Download CDK/minishift
- Rename it to `minishift`
- Configure the PATH
- Configure CDK
- Start the environment with *minishift start*

[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
# From the Downloads folder (or any other folder)
$ sudo mv cdk-3.* /usr/local/bin/minishift
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/minishift

# Setup CDK
$ minishift setup-cdk

# Configure minishift credentials
$ export MINISHIFT_USERNAME=<Red_Hat_username>
$ export MINISHIFT_PASSWORD=<Red_Hat_password>

# Start CDK/minishift
$ minishift start
----

#### kubectl

To install kubectl binary, follow the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl[Install kubectl binary via curl] tutorial

TIP: macOS users can install `kubectl` through homebrew using the following command `brew install kubectl`

### Login in the cluster

This lab uses link:https://www.openshift.org/[OpenShift], which is an Enterprise distribution of Kubernetes. Because of some Enterprise features like security, it's needed to authenticate against this cluster.

To authenticate in the cluster, you need to access to the `oc` binary. You can add the oc binary to you path by running the following command:

[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
# Add oc binary to the PATH
$ eval $(minishift oc-env)

# Login in the cluster
$ oc login OPENSHIFT_IP:8443

# Example:
$ oc login $(minishift ip):8443
----

TIP: If you are using minishift, use the credentials *developer/developer* - If you are running using another environment, make sure to use the provided credentials.
